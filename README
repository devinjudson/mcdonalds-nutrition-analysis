# Best McDonald’s Meals for Cutting or Bulking

## Problem
Fast food doesn’t have to derail your goals.  
This project analyzes McDonald’s nutrition data to identify the best menu items for two scenarios:  

- **Cutting** → maximizing protein while minimizing calories.  
- **Bulking** → maximizing both protein and calories for muscle growth.  

The goal is to provide a quick reference for making smarter choices when you’re short on time but still want to stay on track with your fitness.

## ⚙Method
- **Cleaning**  
  Converted columns to proper types, removed unnecessary whitespace, standardized serving sizes, dropped invalid rows, and added calculated metrics.  

- **Metrics**  
  - *Cutting Score* = `protein / calories` → higher values mean more protein per calorie.  
  - *Bulking Score* = `protein * log(calories)` → balances protein content with calorie intake.  

- **Ranking**  
  Sorted items by each score and extracted the top 5 results.

## Results
The top-ranked items for each scenario are saved in:  
- `top_cutting.csv` → best choices for cutting.  
- `top_bulking.csv` → best choices for bulking.
